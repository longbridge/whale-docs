# Overview

The backend announcement management module is primarily used by broker operations personnel to publish system-related announcements directed at clients on trading terminals such as the mobile app. Such announcements may fall within the following categories:

1. Brokerage business notices: Brokers may issue announcements related to brokerage operations, including changes to trading rules, the launch of new products, adjustments to trading fees, and changes to trading hours. These notices are intended to convey important information and updates regarding brokerage services to clients.
2. System service change notices: Brokers may publish announcements concerning changes to system services, including system maintenance schedules, upgrade plans, and system fault repairs. These notices aim to inform clients of changes to system services so that they can make appropriate adjustments and preparations.
3. System-related upgrade notices: Brokers may publish announcements about system upgrades, including the introduction of new features, interface improvements, and optimizations to trading workflows. These announcements are intended to introduce clients to the improvements and optimizations resulting from system upgrades, thereby enhancing the convenience and quality of the trading experience.

Through backend announcement management, brokers can effectively communicate important information and changes to clients, ensuring that clients are promptly informed and able to adapt to the relevant adjustments.
