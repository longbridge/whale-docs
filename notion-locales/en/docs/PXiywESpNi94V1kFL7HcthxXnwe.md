<p>❓ Q: Why am I unable to select the bank card I wish to add when creating a new one?</p>
</div>

A: First, navigate to Payments Management → APP Management → Card‑Issuing Bank & User Card Binding → Country/Region tab to verify whether the card attribute information has been correctly maintained. If the information is correctly maintained but the card still does not appear, it may be due to regulatory restrictions and cards from that country may not be supported.
