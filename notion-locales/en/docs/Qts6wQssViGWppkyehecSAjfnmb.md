<p>❓ Q: What is the source of abnormal withdrawal records?</p>
</div>

A: Abnormal withdrawal records may result from discrepancies between the withdrawal records and the bank’s transaction statements, or from the bank rejecting a submitted withdrawal. Possible causes include the chosen deposit/withdrawal method or the triggering of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) rules; for the specific reason, please contact the bank.

<p>❓ Q: Why do some withdrawals not require manual status updates?</p>
</div>

A: Because certain withdrawal methods are integrated via API channels, approval and disbursement are automated and the system executes the entire process automatically without manual intervention.
