<p>❓ Q: Why, after setting an automatic exchange strategy, have the customer&#39;s funds still not been credited immediately?</p>
</div>

A: Under normal circumstances, customers should receive funds promptly. If the funds remain delayed, possible reasons include:

- The exchange strategy uses a bank exchange and the upstream bank has not completed the exchange; please call the bank to inquire about the progress.
- The customer's submitted exchange amount exceeds the large-amount limit and requires manual review; please go to the "Work Order Center" to check whether there is an unapproved large-amount exchange approval work order.
