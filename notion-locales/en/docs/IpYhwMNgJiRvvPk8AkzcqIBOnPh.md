# 1.6 Primary and Sub-Accounts

# 1.6A Q: How do I open a primary and sub-account?

A: After the client account is successfully opened, add a sub-account by clicking "Associated Account Information" on the detail page under KYC &gt; Account Opening List in the backend, then click "Add New." (See Figure 1.6A-1.)

- Account structure

The primary account may add new cash/margin accounts (see Figure 1.6A-2); a sub-account must be bound to a primary account.

- Account name

The entered name will be displayed on the statement. Each primary/sub-account has an independent securities account number, and statements are issued per securities account number.

<p>The structure type affects the App functions for &quot;Funds Transfer&quot; and &quot;Stock Transfer.&quot;The &quot;Primary/Sub-Accounts&quot; and &quot;Stock Transfer&quot; functions are displayed only when the client&#39;s account has sub-accounts; otherwise they will not be visible.&quot;Funds Transfer&quot; will be displayed because it supports transfers between primary accounts.</p>

# 1.6B Q: How do primary and sub-accounts log in to the App?

A: If a client has primary and sub-accounts, they use the same login phone number to sign in to the App. After logging in, they can operate all primary and sub-accounts for trading and funds/stock transfers; it is not possible to restrict operations to only a specific primary or sub-account’s assets.

# 1.6C Q: Why does modifying information in a sub-account fail or have no response?

A: You need to view the information in the primary applicant account. (See Figure 1.6C-1.)

<p>Primary and sub-accounts share the same set of account information. When one primary or sub-account modifies the information, the changes apply to all associated accounts, for example: account opening information, contact phone/email, authorized person, risk rating, and so on.</p>

1.6D Q: How do I view a sub-account’s information?

A: Open the detail page under Account Management &gt; Account List and click "Switch Associated Account" to switch accounts and view primary and sub-account information.

1.6E Q: Why does the account number displayed after clicking the account number in "Account List" differ from the currently shown account number?

A: Because the client information is actually a single shared record and does not distinguish between securities accounts. If you need to view the corresponding securities account, use the "Switch Associated Account" in the upper right.

# 1.6F Q: Can funds be transferred between primary and sub-accounts?

A: Clients can perform funds transfers in the App (see Figures 1.6F-1 to 1.6F-3). In the backend, transfers can be performed under Assets Account &gt; Inter-Account Transfer (see Figure 1.6F-4), but accounts belonging to different clients cannot be allocated between each other.
