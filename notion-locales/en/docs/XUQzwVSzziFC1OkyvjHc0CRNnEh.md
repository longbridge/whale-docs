# Business Introduction

# Overview

An IPO (Initial Public Offering) is the process by which a company offers its shares to the public for the first time and becomes listed on a stock exchange. This process represents a significant financial milestone for a company, as it enables the company to raise substantial capital through the sale of shares to support business expansion, repay debt, or finance new development initiatives, while also enhancing the company’s public profile and market visibility. For a company, an IPO is a pivotal step in transitioning from a private enterprise to a publicly held company, a transformation that typically results in greater market recognition and improved access to capital.

The subscription of new shares is a core component of the IPO process, involving investors’ purchase of the company’s shares offered in the initial public issuance. This stage plays an important role in determining market demand for the company’s shares and the initial offering price. Investor participation not only supports the company’s capital-raising efforts but also reflects market confidence in and interest regarding the company’s future prospects. The subscription of new shares serves as a bridge between the company and the investment market; through this process, investors gain the opportunity to participate in the company’s growth story, while the company secures the capital necessary to pursue its long-term strategic objectives.

# New Share Subscription Procedures

During the process of subscribing to new shares, brokers primarily perform the following key steps:

1. <b>Client Preparation and Education</b>:
    - Information Provision: Brokers are required to provide clients with comprehensive information, including the background of the company preparing for the IPO, financial data, market analyses, and the prospectus. This information assists clients in making more informed investment decisions.
    - Risk Assessment Education: Brokers should educate clients about the potential risks and returns associated with subscribing to new shares, ensuring that clients hold realistic expectations regarding possible investment outcomes.

2. <b>Receipt and Processing of Subscription Orders</b>:
    - Order Collection: Brokers are responsible for collecting clients’ subscription orders, including the number of shares and the maximum price the client is willing to pay.
    - Ensuring Accuracy: Brokers must verify the accuracy of orders and ensure that all orders are submitted before the IPO deadline.

3. <b>Notifying Clients of Allocation Results</b>:
    - Allocation Result Notification: After the IPO process concludes, brokers should promptly inform clients whether they were successfully allocated new shares and the number of shares assigned to them.
    - Handling Unsuccessful Subscriptions: For clients who were not successfully allocated shares, brokers need to promptly process refunds or notify clients of the unsuccessful allocation.

4. <b>Trade Execution and Fund Management</b>:
    - Trade Execution: For clients who successfully obtain new shares, brokers must execute the stock transactions, including adding the shares to the clients’ portfolios.
    - Fund Handling: Manage the funds related to the new share subscription, ensuring correct debiting of client funds and the smooth settlement and posting of shares.
