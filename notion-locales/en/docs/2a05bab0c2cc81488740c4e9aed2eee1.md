<p>❓ Q: Must wallet address verification be completed before depositing?</p>
</div>

A: Yes. Before depositing any cryptocurrency, the wallet address used by the customer must be verified. Unverified addresses cannot properly receive the corresponding tokens.

<p>❓ Q: What wallet address verification method is currently supported?</p>

<p>❓ Q: After completing wallet address verification, does it apply to deposits for all currencies?</p>

<p>❓ Q: If my wallet address is verified, why do some cryptocurrencies still require a small-amount verification for deposits?</p>
</div>

A: Because those currencies have unique characteristics, each deposit may require a repeated small-amount wallet address verification to safeguard funds.

<p>❓ Q: What should I do if the verification process shows &quot;Payment Failed&quot;?</p>
</div>

A: Please check whether the payment address is correct, whether your account balance is sufficient, and whether your network connection is stable. If the issue persists, contact customer support for assistance.
