# Quick Start

# Prerequisites

You must obtain the following authorizations to use the Rights System normally.

# Coupon Benefits

The benefits are primarily divided into coupons and physical rewards. The system supports coupon creation, management, and settlement functions, as well as physical reward template creation and physical reward issuance management.

## How to configure a coupon?

This module provides a tool for creating new coupons. After creating a coupon here and obtaining the reward template code, it can be issued later via the Activities System or other channels.

The current whale Rights System supports configuration of the following coupon entitlement types:

Operation Instructions

Rule Configuration

After selecting the coupon type to create, each type requires different rule fields. Detailed descriptions follow.

After completing these configuration fields, click Confirm to generate the corresponding coupon and reward template code.

After completing the above information, click Submit to create the reward; the system will automatically generate the corresponding reward template code.

## How to update physical reward shipping information?

Menu path: Operations System &gt; Rights System &gt; Coupon Benefits &gt; Physical Issuance Management

Step 1. Filter users who have provided addresses

<img src="/assets/S7yWbR0Vyo6GcqxlC49j4zlhpzf.png" src-width="1280" src-height="404" align="center"/>

When a user receives a reward but has not provided an address, the shipping status is "Address Not Provided". After the user fills in the address, the status changes to "Address Provided".

You can filter the records here to find those that have provided addresses and are awaiting shipment.

Step 2. Export addresses

Step 3. Modify order status

To prevent users from modifying addresses after exporting them, lock the record status. After exporting, you can batch change the shipping status of the records to "Shipping In Progress"; once changed, users cannot modify the address.

Step 4. Upload tracking numbers

Proceed with offline shipping. After shipment, obtain the tracking number and enter it into the system for the user to view.

<img src="/assets/PAZDb17nMoLhR6xmzfcjFzHZpSg.png" src-width="1280" src-height="752" align="center"/>

After uploading the tracking number, the physical reward issuance workflow is complete.

# Rewards Center

Query all reward records issued through various channels and manually issue coupons or physical rewards to users.

## How to query reward issuance records?

Menu path: Operations System &gt; Rights System &gt; Rewards Center &gt; Reward Issuance

<img src="/assets/QInEbL37moT5WoxAXzSjrrqWpAb.png" src-width="2788" src-height="1042" align="center"/>

This section records all issued rewards, including physical rewards, coupons, and cash; records can be filtered and exported.

## How to issue rewards manually?

Applicable scenarios: As mentioned in the Activities System for non-standard activities, in some cases there are no specific rules and rewards need to be issued manually (for example, to reward long-standing customers); or for ad hoc corrections during online activities. Manual issuance is used in such cases.

Issuing a reward to a single user

Click the "New" button in the top right to open the New Reward Issuance dialog.

<img src="/assets/CKbCbR5IqoJJCqxb759jKIhap2b.png" src-width="2816" src-height="1646" align="center"/>

Issuing rewards to multiple users

If the operation involves a large volume, click "Batch Issue Rewards" in the top right and upload a file to issue rewards to a batch of users at once.

<img src="/assets/XHzIbmQIjoIXukxXiXdjJ1kzpec.png" src-width="2782" src-height="378" align="center"/>

<img src="/assets/WQuybuBUJoaPR3x3dz3j8Fysp8f.png" src-width="2780" src-height="1600" align="center"/>

First select the reward type to be issued, then download the corresponding template file from the template area below (templates differ by reward type—do not reverse the steps).

Fill out the required fields according to the template, then drag the file into the upload box to submit.
