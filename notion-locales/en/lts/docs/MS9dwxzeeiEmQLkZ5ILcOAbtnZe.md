<p>❓ Question: Why does submitting an adjustment indicate “Security code does not exist”?</p>
</div>

Answer: For security-related adjustments, you must select the adjustment page that corresponds to the type of the underlying asset. For example, if the asset type is a fund, the adjustment must be performed on the "Funds" page.

Example:

If a fund (fund code: PE/LB/SMJJ0000001) is entered on the "Stocks" page and submitted, the following error will appear as shown below:

Tip:

For private assets, please select the adjustment type page according to the corresponding asset type. The "Other" option corresponds to the "OTC Other" adjustment page.

<p>❓ Question: Why is &quot;No-Trace Reversal&quot; not available?</p>
</div>

Answer: If the accounting date for the adjustment has already completed the day cut, No-Trace Reversal is not supported. To perform a No-Trace Reversal, please complete the adjustment approval before the end-of-day closing for the accounting date.

<p>❓ Question: Why can&#39;t I select the receiving party when performing a transfer or position transfer?</p>
</div>

Answer: Inter-account fund transfers are supported only between main accounts of the same client and between a client's main account and its sub-accounts. Inter-account position transfers are supported only between sub-accounts under the same primary–subordinate relationship and between a client's main account and its sub-accounts for two-way transfers. (For OB corporate clients, only transfers between sub-accounts under the same primary–subordinate relationship are supported.)
