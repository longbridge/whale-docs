<p>❓ Q: Can customers withdraw temporarily credited cash, stocks, or options?</p>
</div>

A: No. Temporary adjustments only artificially increase asset balances and temporarily enhance the customer's purchasing power to facilitate order placement during trading; they do not increase the assets in the customer's settlement account.

<p>❓ Q: Can temporary adjustments be left without expiration?</p>
</div>

A: Yes. When creating a temporary adjustment, you may specify an expiration time; the system will automatically expire the adjustment upon reaching that time. While active, the temporarily adjusted assets are reflected in the customer's purchasing power. If recovery is required, you can manually expire the adjustment in advance on the "Adjustment Settlement" page.
