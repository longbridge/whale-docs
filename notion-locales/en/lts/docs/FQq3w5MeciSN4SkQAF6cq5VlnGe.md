# 2024-01-13 Release Notes

# 🎉 New Features

- Added: Pre-settlement preparations are divided into Business Operation Checks and System Data Checks
    - Business Operation Checks primarily review business operation status and provide reminders; they may be approved manually depending on the actual situation.
    - System Data Checks primarily perform data validation and cannot be approved manually; if errors occur, contact Customer Service for assistance.
    - Note: Complete end-of-day operations must be finished before January 13.

- Added: Real-time transaction synchronization
    - After adjustment operations such as account adjustments occur, settlement transaction records can be generated in real time (previously they were generated after operation data synchronization).
    - The backend "Transaction Positions" and "Transaction Funds" pages have been taken offline; position transaction records and fund transaction records have been switched to settlement data.
    - Settlement transaction records are now based on real-time synchronization.
    - In extreme cases, settlement transaction records that have not been updated can be refreshed by clicking the "Update Data" button.
