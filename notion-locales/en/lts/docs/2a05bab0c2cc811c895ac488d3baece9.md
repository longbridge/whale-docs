# Quick Start

# Quick Start

# Overview

Coin withdrawal generally refers to the process of transferring cryptocurrencies (such as BTC, ETH, USDT, etc.) from a personal digital wallet or a trading platform account to another address (including other wallets or other trading platform accounts). If conversion to fiat currency is required, one must first complete a sell operation on the trading platform and then withdraw the corresponding fiat to a bank account. This guide focuses on direct cryptocurrency transfer scenarios.

<b>Operation logic</b>: Using the App platform's withdrawal function, enter the recipient address and the transfer amount; after platform review (including WBO work order approval) and blockchain network confirmation, the asset transfer is completed.

## Prerequisites

You must obtain the following authorizations to use the system functions normally:

## HashKey Cryptocurrency Fee Reserve Instructions

When initiating a cryptocurrency withdrawal on the HashKey platform, special attention must be paid to the rules for fee deduction and the account balance reserve requirements. The specifics are as follows:

1. <b>Difference in Fee Deduction Accounts</b>

Blockchain network fees incurred during a cryptocurrency withdrawal (such as miner fees) are deducted from the <b>main account</b> balance; the principal amount of a normal withdrawal is debited from the tenant's corresponding <b>sub-account</b> balance. The two fee-deduction accounts are independent. If the sub-account has sufficient principal but the main account lacks fee balance, the withdrawal request will fail.

1. <b>Main Account Reserve Requirements</b>

To ensure the withdrawal process completes successfully, tenants must reserve a certain amount of the corresponding cryptocurrency in the <b>main account</b> before initiating an outbound crypto transfer (for example, reserve a small amount of BTC when withdrawing BTC, or a small amount of USDT when withdrawing USDT). The reserved amount must cover the estimated fee for this withdrawal (the platform’s 即时 estimate of the fee amount is available on the withdrawal page).

1. <b>Common Issues</b>

If the withdrawal process displays "Insufficient main account fees," you may replenish the corresponding cryptocurrency via the "Main Account Top-up" function, or transfer a small amount from the sub-account to the main account as a fee reserve. After replenishing, you can resubmit the withdrawal request.

## Processing Withdrawal Requests

If a user has already submitted a withdrawal request in the App, the record will be displayed automatically on this page.

Customer-submitted withdrawal requests are automatically routed to a WBO work order (work order identifier: atm.va.coin_withdraw_apply). The system will carry out approval in accordance with the preset approval configuration flow.
