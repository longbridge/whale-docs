# 🎉 New Features

- Company loan limits: intraday trading setting added
    If you do not offer the related service, you do not need to pay attention to this module change. Financing limit configurations should be managed on the "Margin Financing Credit" tab page.

    - For tenants that have enabled intraday trading, a company-level financing limit configuration for intraday trading has been added. The configuration options and logic are the same as those for "Margin Financing Credit" (formerly the "Financing Limit" column).
    - Report RDR034 - Company Loan Limit Overview optimized; intraday trading fields added
    - Path: "Business Parameter Settings" - "Risk Control" - "Company Limit Settings"
