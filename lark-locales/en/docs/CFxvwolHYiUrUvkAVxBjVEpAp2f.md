## Channel Management

A: Dividing into different channels makes financing management and reporting for IPO subscription orders easier. For example, configure the following channels separately:

1. Proprietary funds channel
2. Channel A — financing
3. Channel B — financing

When aggregating orders, consolidating subscription amounts and financing usage by channel facilitates automated system statistics on orders and financing by channel, as shown below:

We recommend configuring different channels for different sources of funds and different subscription methods.

## Fee Configuration

A: When opening an IPO subscription, you can flexibly select different fee packages. Configure multiple fee options in the fee settings and assign the appropriate fee to each IPO subscription method.

A: The system currently does not support tiered charging based on different subscription share quantities. If you require this feature, please consult the corresponding PM or CS to submit a request.

## Financing Pool Configuration

A: When configuring the financing pool, click "More configuration" and adjust the upper and lower limits of shares.

A: When configuring the financing pool, set the financing pool's start time and end time.

A: First, the broker needs an operations system and must define user segments within that system. When configuring the financing pool, click "More configuration," select the user group as "selected customers," and choose the corresponding user segment.

## Debiting

A: Debiting is generally performed after the IPO subscription deadline. After debiting, the order is considered confirmed and cannot be canceled.

A: Yes.

For example, if financed subscriptions close first, after that close you can select only the financed subscription orders to debit. After the cash subscription deadline, select the cash subscription orders to debit.

## Allotment

A: After the lead returns the allotment results, first convert the results into Whale system's custom allotment format and import them into the system. For details, please refer to: [Publishing Allotment Results](https://longbridge.feishu.cn/wiki/CfQ1wR31ViDOdJkaiB0cs1ipnJf)

A: If the broker has integrated FINI - API for automated IPOs, then during allotment select: Automatically obtain FINI allotment results.

Clicking Next will allow you to preview the allotment results without uploading any files.
