# Prerequisites

You must obtain the following permissions to use the system features normally.

# Operating Instructions

## 1. Viewing Risk Warning Records

On the "Risk Warning" page, you can view the list of all clients who have received a Margin Call and whose cases are not yet closed. If you need to liquidate a client's positions, you can locate the corresponding client on that page.
