# Getting Started

# Overview

</div>

- Before a customer initiates wallet address verification, the system will automatically assign the corresponding account to the customer based on the manually imported "Channel Custody Account." The assignment will serve as the foundational association information for subsequent verification and deposit/withdrawal operations, ensuring traceability of fund flows.

- After a customer submits a wallet address that has passed verification, the system will include it in the "whitelist." All whitelisted addresses are centrally maintained in the backend, including address information, the allocated custody account, verification time, status, etc., supporting real-time query and management to ensure operational compliance and fund security.
