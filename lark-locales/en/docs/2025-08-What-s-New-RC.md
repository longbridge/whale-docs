- The Volatility S&P 500 Index is now available on the stock index page. This helps you spot risks during high volatility and identify opportunities to buy undervalued stocks.

- The order table displays the original text of the rejection reason, allowing you to intuitively see the specific information of the current order rejection and make better judgments on order processing.
    - Generally speaking, messages with the prefix "rms." in the reason for rejection from the operator indicate that the Whale system blocked and rejected the request. Please contact us for further confirmation. For other messages, please contact the operator for verification.
