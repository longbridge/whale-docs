# System Overview

# System Introduction

# Overview

The KYC process typically involves multiple personnel and review steps to ensure the authenticity of a client's identity, the legitimacy of their funds, and to assess their risk tolerance.

The following review roles are generally involved:

1. Customer Service / Front Desk Staff:
    - Collect account opening applications and related materials submitted by clients.
    - Check the completeness of application forms and the accuracy of required fields.
    - Assist clients in completing necessary forms and documents.
    - Forward collected materials to subsequent reviewers.

2. Review / Back-Office Staff:
    - Verify and validate the materials submitted by clients.
    - Perform identity verification by comparing the client's identification documents against public databases or third-party identity verification services.
    - Perform address verification by checking the client's proof of address documents.
    - Investigate the client's occupation and financial status and verify related information.
    - Conduct risk assessments to evaluate the client's investment objectives, investment experience, and risk tolerance.
    - Monitor and investigate the client's source of funds to ensure legality and compliance.
    - Based on the review results, decide to approve, reject, or request further verification of the account opening application.

3. Compliance / Risk Control Staff:
    - Reexamine and audit the work of reviewers to ensure review procedures comply with internal policies and legal and regulatory requirements.
    - Provide compliance guidance and recommendations to ensure the KYC process meets regulatory obligations.
    - Monitor and review potential risk issues, such as money laundering and terrorist financing, to ensure compliance.
