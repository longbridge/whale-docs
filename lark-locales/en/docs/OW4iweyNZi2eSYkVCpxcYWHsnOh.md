### Manual Deposit

Back-office operators submit securities transfer-in requests according to the client's instructions.

Step 1: Select the client and confirm the market to which the deposited securities belong for this transaction, the transfer-out broker, the account name, account number, and other related information.

Step 2: Enter the deposited security’s code, confirm whether it is a physical stock, specify the custodian, enter the quantity of shares being transferred in, and provide any necessary remarks based on the actual situation.

If the shares being transferred in are physical stock, select "Yes" for the "Is Physical Stock" option.

### Notify Broker

If the client has not confirmed this transfer with the counterparty broker, back-office operators can use this function to notify the counterparty broker of the details of the client’s transfer in order to proceed with the standard transfer process.

Step 1: Select the broker to which the email should be sent.

If the securities deposit is for physical stock, when submitting a successful processing result you must choose whether to freeze the securities; if freeze is selected, you must also specify the unfreeze time.
