# 1.1.4C Q: How are primary and sub-accounts managed for a company account?

<b>A:</b> There is only one registered mobile phone number; multiple personnel must share its use to perform 2FA (two-factor authentication), entering the login password and receiving the verification code. Primary account types may be distinguished as cash or financing accounts, and sub-account types must follow the primary account type.
