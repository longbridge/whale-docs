# Business Introduction

# Overview

Securities back-office KYC review refers to the business process by which a securities firm verifies and assesses a client's identity and risk during client management and transaction supervision.

# KYC Procedures

When reviewing account opening applications submitted by clients in the back office, a securities firm typically performs the following series of operations and processes to ensure the application's compliance and accuracy.

1. Application receipt and preliminary screening: The firm's back office receives account opening applications submitted by clients and conducts an initial screening. This includes checking the completeness of the application form, the accuracy of required fields, and the presence of necessary supporting documents. If the application is incomplete or contains issues, the firm may request the client to provide the required information or documents.
2. Identity verification: The firm verifies the identity documents submitted by the client. This may be accomplished by cross-referencing public databases or third-party identity verification services. The objective is to ensure that the identity information provided by the client is authentic, valid, and consistent with the information on the application form.
3. Risk assessment: The firm assesses the client's risk tolerance. This typically involves analysis and evaluation of the client's financial situation, investment experience, investment objectives, and risk preferences. Based on the assessment results, the firm can determine the investment products and services suitable for the client.
4. Source of funds investigation: The firm investigates the source of funds provided in the client's application. This includes verifying the client's income sources, asset holdings, and potential fund flow paths. The purpose is to ensure that the client's funds are legitimate and compliant, in order to prevent money laundering and other illicit financial activities.
5. Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing monitoring: The firm conducts anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) monitoring through its back-office systems to identify and report any suspicious transaction activity. This can be achieved through the use of automated systems and risk alert tools to promptly detect potential noncompliance.
6. Review and approval: Upon completion of the aforementioned review steps, the firm performs a final review of the account opening application and makes an approval or rejection decision based on the review results. If the application meets the company's requirements and complies with applicable laws and regulations, the firm will approve the application and proceed with subsequent account opening procedures. If issues or risks are identified, the firm may reject the application or require further verification and investigation.
