### Manual Withdrawal Processing

Back-office operators submit securities withdrawal requests in accordance with the client's instructions.

Step 1: Select the client and confirm information such as the market to which the securities deposited this time belong, the transfer-out broker, account holder name, and account number.

### Notify Broker

If the client has not confirmed this transfer with the counterparty broker, back-office personnel can use this function to notify the counterparty broker of the details of the current transfer so that the normal transfer process can proceed.

Step 1: Select the broker to which the email should be sent.
