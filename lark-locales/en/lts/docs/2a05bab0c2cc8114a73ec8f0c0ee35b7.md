# Business Overview

# Business Introduction

# Overview

Depositing cryptocurrency refers to the process of transferring cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) from one address (for example, another exchange or another person's wallet) to one’s own digital wallet or trading platform account. This process relies on blockchain technology to ensure the secure transfer of assets, and requires wallet address verification to ensure operational compliance and the security of funds.

# Deposit Procedure

1. Open the target platform/wallet and navigate to the "Top-up / Deposit" page.
2. Select the corresponding cryptocurrency and network (must match the sender).
3. Copy the generated deposit address (verify it is correct).
4. Log in to the sender’s platform, paste the address, enter the amount, and submit after completing the security verification.
5. Wait for block confirmations, then check the deposit status on the target platform/wallet.

<p><b>Note:</b> Virtual currency accounts are recorded as combined assets of &quot;cryptocurrency + pricing currency&quot;: deposits and withdrawals are recorded by cryptocurrency alone, and when finally synchronized to a securities account, they are posted under the combined asset (for example: cryptocurrency ETH with designated pricing currency USD will be posted as &quot;VA/HAS/ETHUSD&quot;). When withdrawing, the system will prioritize deducting from the cryptocurrency with the larger available balance; if the balance is insufficient, it will automatically deduct from the next-priority cryptocurrency.</p>
