# 1.1 Account Opening Procedure

# 1.1 Account Opening Process

# 1.1A Q: What is VC review?

A: When a "VC Review Rule" is triggered, it will be displayed in the triggered-rules field and present the corresponding information, for example:

1. Elderly: the user is aged 65 or above
2. Low educational attainment: the user's highest education level is "Primary school or below"
3. After relevant personnel confirm the risks with the client, the VC may be approved

# 1.1B Q: Is there an AML check during account opening?

A: If TESS (a third-party platform) is subscribed, the system will perform a basic AML check via TESS during account opening to determine hits; details can then be viewed by logging into the TESS platform.

# 1.1C Q: What are the account-number rules for online and offline account openings?

A: Online accounts follow the account-generation rules configured by the broker. Offline accounts may use custom account numbers without restriction; if no number is entered, one will be generated according to the rules.

# 1.1D Q: Is there a record of email notifications when an account is successfully opened?

A: You can view sent content on the "Message Center &gt; Message Records &gt; SMS/Email" page. If the relevant function is not visible, please request access to Message Center permissions.

# 1.1E Q: During account application, does the backend check for records similar to existing clients?

A: Yes. The system checks using the client's name and date of birth. On the "KYC &gt; Account Opening List &gt; Details" page, the "Similar Clients" field will provide a prompt and display clients with similar records.

# 1.1F Q: Is there a notification after an account is opened? Are there attachments?

A: For both online and offline account openings, clients will receive SMS and email notifications upon successful account activation.

Individual clients' account-opening emails include attachments of account documents (account application form, W‑8, CRS PDF files); however, attachments are not sent for corporate or joint-account clients because the files are too large to transmit.

Sent notifications can be viewed in "Message Center &gt; Message Records". The following examples are for reference:

- Email template
    Dear xxx,
    Your securities account (xxxx) has been activated. You may view the account application documents in the attachment. The files are encrypted; you must enter a password to open them. Password format: last four digits of the mobile number + last four digits of the identification number. Any letters in the password must be uppercase; ignore any parentheses.
    For example: if the mobile number is 12345678 and the identification number is 123456(X), the document password is 5678456X.
    If there is no mobile number or identification number, use the available four digits only (either the last four digits of the mobile number or the last four digits of the identification number).Next, you may choose to deposit funds to begin your investment journey.
    We wish you a pleasant investment experience!
    Sincerely,xxx Securities

- SMS template:
    [xxx Securities] Dear Chen Dawen, your account 12345678-*********** has been successfully activated. You may launch the app immediately to begin your investment journey.

# 1.1G Q: The client has already opened an account, so why does the App display "Please submit an account opening application" upon login?

A: The new account was not bound to the registered mobile number (see Figure 1.1G-1). You need to modify the login mobile number under "Account Management &gt; Client/Account Information &gt; Edit Client Data" (see Figure 1.1G-2).

If you receive a "phone number is already in use" notice, please perform the following cancellation operations:

1. If the phone number was used to register but the registration did not complete (no securities account generated), you must perform "Cancel Client" in the Work Order Center (see Figure 1.1G-3); search by "phone" to execute "Cancel Client."
2. If the client submitted the account application and completed their information (a securities account was generated), you must first "Cancel Account" (see Figure 1.1G-4) and then "Cancel Client." After cancellation is complete, change the login mobile number in "Edit Client Data" to bind the account.

# 1.1H Q: Why does the system's account opening form not display the client's account number?

A: Only account opening forms for transfer-based openings display the client's account number because the account number is generated in advance; other verification methods do not provide the account number on the form.
