# System Design

Whale CRM is a customer relationship management system designed from a newly integrated perspective to enable brokerage client services teams to manage brokerage customers, including:

<b>Customer lifecycle management</b>, <b>customer KYC documentation review</b>, and <b>account risk management</b>, among other functions.

Whale CRM addresses the following issues:

1. Scattered customer information: Basic customer data, KYC documentation, and business data are dispersed across Excel spreadsheets, text files, and email; there is no single repository that stores all customer information.
2. Cumbersome team collaboration: Cross-team cooperation is inefficient; there are no standardized processes.
3. Lagging risk monitoring: No continuous real-time risk monitoring mechanism has been established; the organization cannot effectively fulfill regulatory obligations or take timely measures.
4. Manual-dependent business management: Task assignment and reporting are not automated; managerial efficiency is low.

In the core account opening process, the Whale CRM system is designed to synchronize the three phases—pre-, mid-, and post-account opening—providing comprehensive management of account opening activities:

- Pre-account opening: Management of the progression from registered user to active account (CRM management)
- During account opening: KYC review process after account documentation submission (KYC process)
- Post-account opening: Ticketing management for account security after account opening (Account management)

The overall business flow of Whale CRM is shown in the diagram below:

The system provides the average account opening duration over a specified interval and the recent account opening success rate as references (automatically calculated by the system).

Additionally, the right section of the home page offers quick-access shortcuts for frequently used CRM operations, facilitating click-through actions.
