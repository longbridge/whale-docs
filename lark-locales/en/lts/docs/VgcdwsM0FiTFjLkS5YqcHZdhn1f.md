# Permission Request

## Permission Policy Model

Whale WBO permission requests adopt a functional permission policy at the primary business module level (no longer based on the secondary menu operational perspective), divided into:

<b>Full-Function Permissions (policy), Read-Only Permissions (policy),</b> and <b>Other Specified Permissions (policy)</b>

Whale users can configure new permission requests according to the new permission policies. The system also supports setting an application period for certain temporary permission policies (default: left blank), which can be entered as a reference for approval as needed.

The new permission policy configuration mode uses "Automatic Policy Updates": when any rule of a policy is changed (whether adding or removing permissions), WBO users do not need to reapply; the changes take effect immediately.

Additionally, if a user selects a menu for which they lack the relevant permissions, the system will first display a prompt; by selecting this prompt the user can proceed directly to the permission request page.

## Role Management Details

This optimization of the Whale WBO permission policy model also updates identity management so that when adding roles to permissions, the new permission policy model is applied.

When adding a new system role, click [Add Role] at the top right and select permission policies to include executable tasks.
