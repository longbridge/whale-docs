# Quick Start

# Overview

The WHALE asset account is primarily used to query asset transaction records and to manage client assets, including asset freezing and unfreezing, account adjustments, and transfers between accounts.

# Quick Start

You must obtain the following authorizations to use the system's functions normally.

## Query Client Asset Details and Transaction History

### Query Client Asset Details

1. Access "Account Query" and select the relevant account dimension to perform the query.

### Query Account Asset Balances and Transaction Details

1. Access "Account Balances" to view all clients' asset balances by asset type — Cash/Stocks/Funds/Options/Bonds/OTC/Virtual Assets. By filtering clients, you can view the asset balances for a specific client. The page also supports queries by currency and account type. The list operation "Details" on this page allows you to further view the client's transaction details.

1. Account details can be accessed from the account balance details or directly from the menu; account details are organized by the same asset types as account balances — Cash/Stocks/Funds/Options/Bonds/OTC/Virtual Assets — and can be viewed in the corresponding tabs.
