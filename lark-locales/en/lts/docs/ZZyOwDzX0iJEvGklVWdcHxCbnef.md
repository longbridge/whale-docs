# FINI Platform 10.1

# 10.1 FINI Platform

# 10.1A Question: If the FINI platform API has been integrated, how does one process an allotment?

<b>Answer:</b> If a broker has integrated FINI via the API to automate IPOs, when an allotment occurs select "Automatically retrieve FINI allotment results," then click Next to preview the allotment results; no file upload is required.

# 10.1B Question: If the API is connected to FINI, how can a new share subscription order be canceled?

<b>Answer:</b> Cancellation can be performed on the "New Share Subscription &gt; Subscription Records" page (see Figure 10.1B-1). If the order status becomes "Charged" (已扣款), it cannot be canceled or rejected. To force a cancellation you must log in to the FINI platform to process it; however, if the deadline has passed, FINI cannot perform the cancellation either.
