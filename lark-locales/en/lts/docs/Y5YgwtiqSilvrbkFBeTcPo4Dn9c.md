# Business Introduction

# Overview

The securities withdrawal service refers to the operational process by which a securities company’s client withdraws funds from a securities account.

# Withdrawal Steps

The basic process for withdrawal services is as follows:

<b>Client Withdrawal Request</b>: The client submits a withdrawal request to the securities company. This can be done through various channels, such as an online platform, by telephone, or by completing a request form at the company’s counter.

<b>Identity Verification</b>: The securities company conducts identity verification of the client. Typically, the client is required to provide identification documents or other relevant identity verification information.

<b>Source of Funds Confirmation</b>: Confirm the source of the withdrawn funds. The securities company may request documentation proving the source of funds to ensure that the funds are lawful and compliant.

<b>Application Processing</b>: After receiving the client’s withdrawal request, the securities company performs internal review and processing. They will verify the available funds in the client’s account and the requested withdrawal amount to ensure that requirements are met.

<b>Funds Transfer</b>: The securities company transfers the client-specified funds to the designated account. This may involve fund transfer operations with banks or other financial institutions.

<b>Confirmation Notice</b>: Once the funds transfer is complete, the securities company sends a confirmation notice to the client informing them that the withdrawal has been completed.

<b>Settlement</b>: The securities company carries out internal accounting settlement to ensure the accuracy of the withdrawal operation.

<b>Records and Reporting</b>: The securities company records the withdrawal transaction in the client’s account and generates related reports. These records and reports assist in monitoring and auditing the compliance of withdrawal operations.
