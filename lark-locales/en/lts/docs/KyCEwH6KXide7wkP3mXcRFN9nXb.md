# 13. Message Center (Email / SMS)

# 13A Q: Why would a particular email address be prohibited from sending?

<b>A:</b> This email address has recorded bounces in its delivery history. An excessively high bounce rate may cause the vendor to suspend the account. To ensure the normal availability of email services, the system identifies addresses that have bounced and adds them to a blacklist; therefore, that email address will be prohibited from sending.

# 13B Q: How can I find sent emails/SMS messages?

<b>A:</b> In the backend, on the "Message Center &gt; Message Records &gt; SMS/Email" page you can view records of sent emails and SMS messages.
You can filter sent records by client account, recipient email, and sending scenario.
