<p> Question: Why are clients’ submitted deposit requests immediately approved and reflected in the deposit records?</p>

<p>Question: What is the difference between the &quot;Deposit Refund&quot; and &quot;Withdrawal Refund&quot; functions on the deposit matching page?</p>
</div>

Answer: "Deposit Refund" refers to the operation of returning the bank transaction generated by a deposit to the customer via the original payment channel. "Withdrawal Refund" refers to situations where a client’s withdrawal is rejected by the bank and is passively recorded as a bank inflow; that inflow record must be linked to the corresponding withdrawal record to facilitate subsequent financial reconciliation.

<p>Question: If the direct posting function is used but the client does not provide bank transaction details at the time of posting, and the bank transaction is generated after posting is completed, can the transaction details be added to that record?</p>
</div>

Answer: Yes. Use the "Import Bank Transactions" function on the deposit records page: download the import template, fill in the template fields, and upload the file to the system to complete the supplementation of the bank transaction details.
