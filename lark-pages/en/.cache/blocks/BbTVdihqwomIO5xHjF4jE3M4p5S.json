Such professional management can reduce the investor’s management burden and improve investment efficiency and returns. In addition, purchasing funds is relatively simple and convenient, as investors do not need to directly buy or manage individual stocks or bonds; the fund management company administers these holdings on behalf of investors, providing convenience and flexibility.","text_element_style":{"bold":false,"inline_code":false,"italic":false,"strikethrough":false,"underline":false}}}],"style":{"align":1,"folded":false}}},{"block_id":"doxjpU366PGs19JY0UDeTITwJLd","block_type":2,"parent_id":"BbTVdihqwomIO5xHjF4jE3M4p5S","text":{"elements":[{"text_run":{"content":"In summary, fund investment offers investors diversified and professional investment options, enabling them to participate in the market with ease and obtain corresponding investment returns.
