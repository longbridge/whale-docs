<p>❓ Q: What is the difference between the [Reject] function on the withdrawal request page and the [Delete] function on the withdrawal details page?</p>
</div>

A: They apply to different scenarios. [Reject] primarily addresses whether the submitted information as a whole is correct, for example, if the account was entered incorrectly. [Delete] is used when the application-level information is correct but a specific detail line does not need to be processed for transfer.
