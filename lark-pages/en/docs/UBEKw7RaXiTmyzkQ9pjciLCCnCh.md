# 1. Account Issues

# 1A Q: In the Ticket Center, what is the difference between freezing a client and freezing an account?

<b>A:</b> Freezing a client — the client is frozen, preventing App login; an operator can unfreeze the client (see 1A Figure 1).Freezing an account — the account is frozen, preventing the individual securities account from trading, depositing/withdrawing funds, or currency exchange; an operator can activate (unfreeze) the account (see 1A Figure 2).

<b>A:</b> "Customer Status" indicates whether the customer is Deactivated / Frozen / Active (corresponding to Ticket Center - Deactivate Customer & Freeze Customer)."Account Status" indicates whether the securities account is Deactivated. If the account has been frozen but not deactivated, it will display as Active (corresponding to Ticket Center - Deactivate Securities Account).

"Account Freeze Status" indicates whether the securities account is frozen (corresponding to Ticket Center - Freeze Account).

# 1C Q: If the Customer Type / Customer Subtype was selected incorrectly, how can it be corrected?

<b>A:</b> If the Customer Type (e.g., Individual Account, Corporate Account, Joint Account) was selected incorrectly, the account must be deactivated and reopened.If the Customer Subtype (Retail denotes a retail customer; House denotes the firm’s proprietary account, e.g., `testing acc`, `error acc`) was selected incorrectly, it can be modified on the KYC &gt; Account Opening List details page by hovering over the corresponding field and clicking the pencil icon.

# 1E Q: How does a customer set the App login password?

<b>A:</b> Upon successful account opening, the customer will receive the login password via SMS. The password must be at least eight characters and include uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. To reset, in the App select the login method (see 1E Figure 1), then tap "Forgot Password" (see 1E Figure 2).

For backend resets, on the Account Management &gt; Customer / Account Information page select "Unlock Password" and choose "Login Password" as the unlock target (see 1E Figure 3) to reset the customer's failed-attempt count so they can attempt to log in again, or select "Reset Password" to issue a new login password (see 1E Figure 4).
