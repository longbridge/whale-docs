# Business Introduction

# Overview

Traders can use the "Trade Inquiry" grouping to perform order supplementation, new stock management and subscription, securities blacklist and whitelist restrictions, trade allocation, and order approval; all trading-related restrictions and approvals can be handled through this grouping.

# Main Features

1. Order Supplementation
    - Allows supplementary entry of orders for clients; when a client's order is abnormal and requires after-the-fact supplementation, this function can be used to record the order into the trading system.

2. New Stock Management
    - The new-issue list enables viewing which new stocks are available for subscription and supports viewing subscription requirements as well as financing-related requirements.
    - Supports viewing client subscription details to facilitate the management and monitoring of clients' subscription activities.

3. Securities Restrictions
    - This feature can impose restrictions on stock trading, thereby effectively mitigating upstream or risk-control trading risks.
    - Supports configuring blacklisted securities; trading can be restricted based on buy/sell direction and opening/closing position actions.

4. Trade Allocation
    - When a user executes trades through a master account and subsequently needs to allocate executed orders to other sub-accounts, the allocation function can accomplish this.

5. Order Approval
    - When an order triggers a risk-control approval requirement, it will enter this list; risk-control personnel can use this function to centrally approve clients' transactions.
