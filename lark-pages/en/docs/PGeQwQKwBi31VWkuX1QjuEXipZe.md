# Overview

In the securities market, public funds and private funds are two primary investment vehicles widely used by investors.

Public funds are issued by fund management companies and are open to the public for purchase and redemption. These funds generally feature relatively low investment thresholds, and investors can acquire them via securities exchanges or fund distribution institutions. Public funds are managed by professional fund management teams; by purchasing fund shares, investors can indirectly invest in assets such as equities and bonds, thereby achieving asset diversification and professional management. By contrast, private funds are issued to specified investors, have higher investment thresholds, and involve relatively more complex subscription procedures. Private funds operate with greater flexibility, typically encompassing a wider range of investment strategies and market approaches, and are suitable for institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals.

There are multiple reasons why investors participate in fund investment. First, fund investment can help investors diversify risk. By allocating capital across different asset classes and industries, investors can reduce the risk associated with a single investment and achieve a more resilient portfolio. Second, funds are managed by professional fund management teams that perform asset allocation and trading based on market conditions and the fund’s investment objectives, seeking to deliver optimal returns for investors. Such professional management can reduce the investor’s management burden and improve investment efficiency and returns. In addition, purchasing funds is relatively simple and convenient, as investors do not need to directly buy or manage individual stocks or bonds; the fund management company administers these holdings on behalf of investors, providing convenience and flexibility.

In summary, fund investment offers investors diversified and professional investment options, enabling them to participate in the market with ease and obtain corresponding investment returns. Whether public funds or private funds, investors can select suitable investment products according to their own needs and risk preferences, and participate in the market through straightforward purchase and redemption procedures to pursue long-term wealth growth.

# Fund Management Procedures

In fund operations, brokers primarily execute the following key steps:

1. Accept investors’ subscription and redemption instructions: Clients submit subscription and redemption applications via the terminal. The broker must receive the client instructions and simultaneously freeze the required funds, aggregate clients’ subscription and redemption orders in accordance with business rules, and generate the fund files.
2. Submit fund files to the upstream processor and await confirmation from the fund company: Operations personnel verify the generated fund orders in the fund management backend, send the subscription and redemption data to the upstream processor, and wait for the fund company to return share and amount information.
3. Backfill order data: Upon receipt of the fund company’s files, backfill fund net asset value, subscription shares, redemption amounts, and other relevant information, and perform verification and confirmation.
4. Subscription and redemption settlement: Settlement is conducted manually or automatically, encompassing subscription settlement and redemption settlement for securities and cash. The system debits client funds according to subscription orders and increases the client’s fund share holdings; for redemption orders, the system deducts the client’s shares and returns funds to the client.
5. Complete settlement and notify the client: Back-office personnel settle funds with the fund custodian through the bank, generate the fund transaction confirmation, and send it to the client.
