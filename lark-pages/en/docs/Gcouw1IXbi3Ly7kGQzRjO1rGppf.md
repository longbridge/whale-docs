# Business Overview

Margin Call (margin top-up notice) is a risk management measure employed by brokers. It occurs when a trader using leverage incurs losses on positions that cause the margin balance to fall below the margin level required by the broker, or when market fluctuations reduce the balance below the maintenance margin level; in such cases, the broker will issue a Margin Call to the trader. Upon receiving a Margin Call, the trader must promptly—typically within three trading days—either close positions independently or deposit funds into their margin account until the account balance returns to the broker’s required margin level; otherwise, the broker reserves the right to liquidate the client’s positions on their behalf without prior notice.
