# 19. Account Asset Issues

# 19A Q: In "Account Details" under "Cash Details," what do Total, T0, T1, T2 and TN for "Cash Pending Settlement" represent?

A:

1. Total is a real‑time figure; it will be updated if trades during the trading session give rise to amounts pending settlement.
2. T0 and T1 are the amounts pending settlement taken from yesterday’s clearing file and will not be updated by trades occurring on the same day.
3. If there are trades on the same day, Total will update while T0, T1, and T2 will not. When T0 + T1 + T2 does not equal Total, the system displays TN to account for the difference.
4. After the end‑of‑day processing completes, T0 will disappear. Amounts pending settlement generated by that day’s trades will become T2.

# 19B Q: Why do the "Funds Balance" on the statement and the "Withdrawable Cash" and "Manual FX Balance" in the backend asset overview differ?

A: "Withdrawable Cash" and "Manual FX Balance" use the same values, whereas the difference between "Withdrawable Cash" and "Funds Balance" is that the latter includes settled funds.

For example, if the settled cash on 23/4 is $10,000, but "Withdrawable Cash" must deduct unsettled purchase amounts from 22/4 of, for example, $2,000, then "Withdrawable Cash" and "Manual FX Balance" would be $8,000.

<p>During end‑of‑day clearing and charging, fees may be unfrozen or actual fees deducted, and as a result the withdrawable cash may change after clearing and charging.</p>
