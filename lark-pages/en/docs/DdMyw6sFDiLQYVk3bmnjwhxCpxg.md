# CRS Operations Manual

This user manual is intended for administrators and authorized users of the Longbridge Whale WBO securities back-office management system. By reading this manual, you will learn how to operate the Whale WBO "CRS File" module and perform its functions.

# CRS File Operation Instructions

Menu path: Reports Management &gt; CRS File Generation

- Note: The tenant must be granted the following permissions in order to operate the related CRS files.

The overall CRS file operation generally follows the sequence shown below.

## 1. Calculate Income

First, click "Calculate Income" in the upper right corner. After entering the reporting year and the identifier (company name), a file-generation task will be created (visible in the Tasks List tab).

Note: In the Calculate Income window, the external tax filing website will provide a reference number. The company name must be the brokerage's company name and must match the name used in the external tax filing system.

A system task will be created at this time. When the system task completes (this may take some time to compile the full-year data), the system will assign a common "Message Number" to this batch of CRS data.

You may also click the "Details" control to the right of a record in the Tasks List tab; this will automatically switch to the CRS Data tab, where you can view or edit the data.

<img src="/assets/QBqHbsDDfoxqU9xLXacj2zZJpXb.png" src-width="1280" src-height="616" align="center"/>

You may delete records (not to be submitted) or modify the data as needed.

## 2. Generate File

After verifying or editing the CRS Data on the CRS Data tab, the system will determine the message status and tag it as:

- CRS701 = The message contains new information — indicates new data upload.

New message [CRS701]: new[CRS701]

- CRS702 = The message contains corrections for previously sent information — indicates corrections or deletions.

Correction message [CRS702]: corrections[CRS702]

You may query using the following criteria as needed (the following is for reference only):

Input: <b>Year / Message Type / Identifier / Batch / Message Number</b> and run the query. The Generate File function will then become available.

Click the "Generate File" button in the upper right corner to create a system task that will produce a tax-filing specification document.
(Note: this may take some time to compile the full-year data.)

1. File Download

When the file-generation task is complete, you may download the archive and upload it to the external website.

(The system will generate a document with an .xml extension.)

<img src="/assets/IIkwbhZDPoP0cQx8Z3mjlr2Wpgf.png" src-width="2480" src-height="540" align="center"/>

<img src="/assets/E8P3bgxTioWLXjxqzRejAGblpvc.png" src-width="581" src-height="667" align="center"/>

Recommendation: Do not edit this file manually; improper modifications may cause the file to fail to meet the required specification and prevent successful upload.

## 3. Upload Generated File

Upload the generated XML file to the external system. After the external system processes the upload, it will return a file serial number. Update the status in the Tasks List tab by entering the external system's serial number.

<img src="/assets/CfQ9bxae0oGJnwxl16Sj1yD3pJh.png" src-width="2472" src-height="552" align="center"/>

<img src="/assets/Pi79bKeB7orlLkxnjN8jHLwUppg.png" src-width="2462" src-height="843" align="center"/>

This associates the CRS data with the file serial number for that batch, making it easier to query or correct previously submitted information in the future.

## 4. Correct Data and Re-upload

Under normal circumstances, the status of submitted data will be "File Submitted."

<img src="/assets/UKqHbjBZ9ohfY0xq5vIjpemBpoc.png" src-width="1032" src-height="529" align="center"/>

If you discover that data needs to be changed, click "Edit" on the right to modify the data.

<div class="callout callout-bg-5 callout-border-5 callout-color-1">
<div class='callout-emoji'>🎁</div>
<p>The system will create a new data record that can be modified as needed.</p>
</div>

Alternatively, you may "Delete" submitted data.

<div class="callout callout-bg-5 callout-border-5 callout-color-1">
<div class='callout-emoji'>🎁</div>
<p>The system will mark the deleted record as locked.</p>
</div>

Then, using the same operation flow, input: <b>Year / Message Type / Identifier / Batch / Message Number</b> and run the query. The Generate File function will again be available.

Generate the file and upload it to the submission website. The external system will return the latest file serial number, which you should update accordingly.
