# 2.0.1 Deposit and Withdrawal Modification / Rejection

# 2.0.1A Question: A withdrawal/deposit application has been submitted in the backend; how can I reject the application?

<b>Answer:</b> For applications that have already been submitted, you must reject them within the ticket (see Figure 2.0.1A-1). The top-up status will be updated to "Rejected" (see Figure 2.0.1A-2). If necessary, you may then submit another withdrawal/deposit application.

# 2.0.1B Question: A withdrawal application has already been processed for approval; how can I reject the customer's withdrawal/deposit application?

<b>Answer:</b> If the withdrawal application has been submitted and confirmed, those applications that have not yet been approved on the "Batch Pending" page can be rejected. If the application has already been approved, click "View and Update Result" to change the status to "Failed," then submit another withdrawal.

# 2.0.1C Question: Can a deposit be modified or revoked after it has been posted?

<b>Answer:</b> With the appropriate permission keys enabled, this can be performed. See the following steps.

<div class="callout callout-bg-5 callout-border-5 callout-color-1">
<div class='callout-emoji'>🎁</div>
<p><b>Deposit transaction modification approval</b> <code>atm.deposit_jour_update_approval</code>; <b>Deposit transaction modification</b> <code>atm.deposit_jour_update_ticket</code><b>Deposit transaction deletion approval</b> <code>atm.deposit_jour_delete_approval</code>; <b>Deposit transaction deletion</b> <code>atm.deposit_jour_delete_ticket</code></p>
</div>

Completed deposits can be modified or deleted on the same day (see Figure 2.0.1C-1). After performing a modification or deletion, approval is required (see Figures 2.0.1C-2 and 2.0.1C-3). The deposit record will be reflected in the related transaction flows (see Figure 2.0.1C-4).
