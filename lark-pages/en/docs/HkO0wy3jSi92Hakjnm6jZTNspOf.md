<p>Q: What is the source of abnormal withdrawal records?</p>
</div>

A: Abnormal withdrawal records may result from discrepancies between the withdrawal records and the bank’s transaction statements, or from the bank rejecting a submitted withdrawal. Possible causes include the chosen deposit/withdrawal method or the triggering of AML (Anti-Money Laundering) rules; for the specific reason, please contact the bank.
