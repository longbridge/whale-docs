# Business Introduction

# Overview

The Corporate Actions System is an important component of the securities back office, primarily used to process corporate equity change–related transactions, including dividends, share consolidations and splits, share exchanges, and other similar actions.

At present, the Corporate Actions System supports multiple types such as CBBC redemption, share consolidations and splits, dividends, rights issues, offers, and ADRs. The WTT front-end Corporate Actions page only supports viewing customer-related processing details and does not currently support operational handling of related transactions.
