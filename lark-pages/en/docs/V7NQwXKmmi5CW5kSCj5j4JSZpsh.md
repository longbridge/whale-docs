# 6.2B Q: What does the plan type "Odd-Lot to Cash Dividend" mean?

<b>A:</b> Selecting "Yes" indicates that shares insufficient to form one whole share will be paid in cash. If "No" is selected, they will be forfeited.

For example: if a corporate action issues 1 share for every 10 shares, and Client A holds 1,000 shares while Client B holds 1,005 shares, the exercised shares for each will be 100 shares; the system will automatically convert the remaining 5 shares to cash.

# 6.2C Q: After modifying the "Plan Information" for a corporate action, what are the next steps?

A: After modifying the "Plan Information," verify that the "Client Details" are correct, click "Re-register," and then click "Submit for Execution" to continue and complete the corporate action.

# 6.2D Q: Can dividends from a corporate action be received in a different currency? How do I modify the plan information?

A: In "Plan Information," click "Edit," add the "BE-CASH DIVIDEND" plan, enter the "Exchange Rate" and the "Dividend Rate" (dividend per share), then click "Re-register" to retrieve the latest data.
