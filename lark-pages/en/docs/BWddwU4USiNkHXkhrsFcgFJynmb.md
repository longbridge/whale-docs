The WTT Components Toolbox provides the access point for trading-related components.

# Quick Start

- Locate trading-related components under the Trading category in the Components Toolbox at the top-right corner of WTT; components can be dragged onto the panel or used independently.

- If you do not have permission to open a component, you may submit a permission request. After an administrator approves the request in the WBO backend, refresh this page or log in again to use the component.
