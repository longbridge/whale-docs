<p>❓ Question: If a client&#39;s position-closing operation was executed in error and needs to be canceled, what should be done?</p>
</div>

Answer: There are two ways to cancel an order:

1. On the "Margin Call" - "Close Position Orders" page, locate the relevant close position orders, select the order you wish to revoke, and choose the "Cancel" action.
2. On the "Margin Call" - "Risk Alerts" page (for intra-day margin, use "Intra-Day Margin Real-Time Alerts"), filter for the corresponding client and enter the "Details" page; within "Liquidation in Progress" you can perform the "Cancel" action.

<p>❓ Question: If, due to temporary special circumstances, a liquidation is not required and ongoing records need to be monitored, what can be done?</p>
</div>

Answer: If you need to change the margin call status, use "Edit" on the main list page of "Risk Alerts"; if you only need to make a brief record to facilitate subsequent follow-up or to share information with the next handler, record the relevant information in the "Follow-Up Record" on the "Details" page of the main list.
