# System Overview

# System Introduction

# Overview

The Whale Help Center primarily supports the creation and management of various customer-facing article content, including help documentation, frequently asked questions, market updates, stock market content, and event rules. It also supports broker-customized article categories and content maintenance.

The Help Center consists of two parts: article categories and articles.

# Articles

Created articles are displayed on the article list page and support actions such as [Edit], [Hide]/[Show], and [Delete]. Additionally, an article will only appear on the corresponding platform when its status is "Visible."

- For articles with the "Visible" status, the [Hide] action is available.
- For articles with the "Hidden" status, the [Show] or [Delete] actions are available.
