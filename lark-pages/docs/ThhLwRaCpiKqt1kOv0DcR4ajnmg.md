# Business Introduction

# Overview

In the securities industry, deposit services refer to the process by which investors add funds to their securities accounts. This is a necessary step for participating in securities market transactions; investors must have sufficient funds in their securities accounts to purchase stocks, bonds, or other securities products.

# Deposit Procedures

The basic process for deposit services is as follows:

<b>Selecting a securities broker</b>: Investors must first select a securities broker, which is a financial institution that provides securities trading services. Securities brokers typically offer online platforms that enable investors to conveniently execute trades and manage their securities accounts.

<b>Opening a securities account</b>: After selecting a broker, investors must complete the account opening process. This typically involves filling out the relevant account application forms and providing necessary documents such as proof of identity and proof of address. Once the account is successfully opened, the investor will be assigned a unique account number.

<b>Choosing a deposit method</b>: Securities brokers generally provide multiple deposit methods, including bank transfers, wire transfers, and check deposits. Investors can choose the method that best suits their needs and convenience.

<b>Making the deposit</b>: Investors transfer funds into their securities accounts using their chosen deposit method. This typically requires providing necessary information such as the transfer amount and payer account information. Some securities brokers may also require identity verification to ensure the security of the funds.

<b>Confirming the deposit</b>: Once the funds have been successfully credited to the securities account, the investor will receive a confirmation notice, which usually includes the deposited amount and the deposit date. This is an important step to ensure that the funds have been correctly received.

<b>Commencing trading</b>: Once there are sufficient funds in the account, investors may begin trading securities. They can use the trading platform provided by the securities broker to buy or sell stocks, bonds, or other securities products.
