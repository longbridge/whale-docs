    <img src="/assets/K5dSbHGCmoQ6ULxzJPsjQQ5cpMb.png" src-width="1280" src-height="313" align="center"/>
    - Feature added: A "Supplemental Deposit Name" entry has been added to customer bank cards to address scenarios where the name on file with the bank is inconsistent with KYC information.
    - Use case: When the bank‑registered name is inconsistent with KYC information, this feature allows supplementary name entry. Names that pass manual review will be automatically applied to subsequent eDDA authorizations, deposit auto‑matching, and bank card binding.
    - Work‑order approval workflow: Create / Edit / Delete operations all require work‑order approval. The following work orders must be configured:
        - WBO - Funds Management - Deposits - New "Supplemental Deposit Name" Pending Approval
        - WBO - Funds Management - Deposits - Edit "Supplemental Deposit Name" Pending Approval
        - WBO - Funds Management - Deposits - Delete "Supplemental Deposit Name" Pending Approval
    - Path: WBO - Funds Management - Customer Bank Cards
    - Permissions:
        - Supplemental Deposit Name Inquiry `atm.update_deposit_name_inquiry`
        - Supplemental Deposit Name Operation `atm.update_deposit_name_operation`
