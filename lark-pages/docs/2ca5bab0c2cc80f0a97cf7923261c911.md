# Release Notes — 2025-12-15

# 2025-12-15 Release Notes

# 🪀 Improvements and Fixes

- Submitting a withdrawal application can trigger the generation of a work order, with corresponding backend page optimizations
    - The single-function preset is not enabled (to avoid impacting online operations); the approval flow configuration is visible and requires a submitted delivery change to enable (work order identifier: atm.withdraw_app_audit);
    - When not enabled, operations follow the existing process;
    - Once enabled, an audit work order will be automatically generated for the application; if the customer withdraws the application prior to audit, an exception work order will be created (which must be closed by a super administrator and does not affect the underlying withdrawal transaction);
    - A new Tab entry has been added to the withdrawal application to facilitate switching views as needed.
    - Path: Securities Back Office - Funds Management - Withdrawals - Withdrawal Applications

- Withdrawal rejection page optimization
    - The withdrawal rejection page now includes copy prompts: if the current counter has work order approval enabled, the prompt reads, "After confirmation, the request will undergo work order approval; upon approval, a notification will be sent to the customer indicating that the withdrawal has been rejected." If the current counter does not have work order approval enabled, the prompt reads, "After confirmation, a notification will be sent to the customer indicating that the withdrawal has been rejected immediately."
