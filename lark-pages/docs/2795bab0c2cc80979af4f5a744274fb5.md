# Release Notes — September 29, 2025

# 2025-09-29 Release Notes

# 🪀 Improvements and Fixes

- Linked rejection handling rule for matched account-opening deposits

    - In account-opening deposit scenarios, if a submitted deposit application has already been matched, once the account-opening request is rejected, the system will automatically reject the matched account-opening deposit record; following the rejection, the system will also automatically revoke the customer's deposit application.
    - Path: WBO - Funds Management - Deposits - Account-Opening Deposits

- Optimization: automatic carry-forward of previous day’s exchange rates

    - For scenarios where the exchange rate type is “Book Rate,” the system adds a process to automatically carry forward the previous day’s exchange rates: if the current exchange rates for each currency have not yet been imported, the system will automatically copy the previous day’s corresponding currency rates to fill the gaps.
    - Path: WBO - Funds Management - Currency Exchange - Reference Rates
