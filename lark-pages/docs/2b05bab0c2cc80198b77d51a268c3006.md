    - WBO has added cryptocurrency deposit and withdrawal capabilities to meet clients' crypto on‑ramp and off‑ramp needs. Prior to use, permission requests must be completed and the withdrawal application workflow (identifier: atm.va.coin_withdraw_apply) must be configured for approval. The core modules, functions, and navigation paths are as follows:
        1. Channel Custodial Accounts: Supports bulk addition of channel custodial accounts; channel custodial accounts that are not allocated may be deleted manually in the backend.
            - Path: WBO - Virtual Asset Management - Crypto Deposit & Withdrawal - Channel Custodial Accounts
        2. Client Wallet Addresses: Clients must complete the wallet address allowlist process before conducting cryptocurrency deposits or withdrawals; allowlisted client wallet addresses will be maintained in the backend.
            - Path: WBO - Virtual Asset Management - Crypto Deposit & Withdrawal - Client Wallet Addresses
        3. Deposits: Supports deposit application inquiries; the full deposit workflow for clients can be viewed in the backend, and backend refund and cancellation operations are supported.
            - Path: WBO - Virtual Asset Management - Crypto Deposit & Withdrawal - Deposits
        4. Withdrawals: Client withdrawal applications can be reviewed and approved in the backend; the full withdrawal workflow is queryable. For HashKey crypto withdrawals, blockchain fees are deducted from the master account while principal amounts are deducted from sub‑accounts. Tenants must pre‑reserve sufficient corresponding cryptocurrency in the master account (to cover estimated fees) to avoid application failures. If a fee‑insufficiency warning appears, the master account can be topped up or funds can be transferred from sub‑accounts and the request resubmitted.
            - Path: WBO - Virtual Asset Management - Crypto Deposit & Withdrawal - Withdrawals
        5. Cryptocurrencies: Supports adding and editing cryptocurrency information in the backend.
            - Path: WBO - Business Parameter Settings - Capital Parameters - Cryptocurrencies
    - Note: Virtual coin accounts are recorded using a combined instrument of "cryptocurrency + pricing currency": deposits and withdrawals are recorded per cryptocurrency, and when ultimately synchronized to the securities account, the combined instrument is used for posting (for example: cryptocurrency ETH with pricing currency USD will be posted as "VA/HAS/ETHUSD"). When debiting out, the system will preferentially deduct from the currency with the larger available balance; if the balance is insufficient, it will automatically deduct from the next priority currency.

# 🪀 Improvements & Fixes

- Support for Manual Selection of Exchange Strategy during Backend Manual Currency Conversion

    <img src="/assets/YbNGbouQxoyEH0xqmBzjOJXypZe.png" src-width="3268" src-height="876" align="center"/>
    - When performing "Manual Currency Conversion" in the backend, users can manually select the exchange strategy as needed; once manually selected, the client's currency exchange will be executed immediately. The page defaults to a system‑determined mode; in this mode, exchanges will be completed according to the exchange strategy preset by the operator.
If the configured "exchange strategy" contains only all exchange types defined by the system default, after the client submits a conversion request, matching exchange pool types will be aggregated and displayed as "--", and the exchange strategy will be shown using the system default value.
