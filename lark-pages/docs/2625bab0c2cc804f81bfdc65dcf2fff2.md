- Customer Bank Cards / Securities Deposit — Bulk Add Interaction Enhancements
    - The Bulk Add feature now includes a secondary confirmation page: only after clicking "Confirm" will records that have been successfully parsed be imported; additionally, a "Minimize Window" action has been added to the import page (supports exiting to the background). To retry an operation, click the corresponding record in the transfer list at the top right to return to the original page.
    - Path 1: WBO - Funds Management - Customer Bank Cards
    - Path 2: WBO - Securities Management - Securities Deposit - Deposit Limits
