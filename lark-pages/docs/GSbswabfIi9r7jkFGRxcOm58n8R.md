# 1.2 Maintenance/Modify Account

# 1.2A Q: How do I modify customer information?

<div class="callout callout-bg-5 callout-border-5 callout-color-1">
<div class='callout-emoji'>🎁</div>
<p>When the customer review status is &quot;Submitting account opening information&quot; it cannot be changed; when it is &quot;Pending review&quot; or &quot;Account opened&quot; it can be changed. Permission: <code>kyc.update_account_info</code></p>
</div>

Answer: (i) To change a customer's basic information, on the "KYC &gt; Account Opening List" detail page move the cursor to the field you wish to modify; a pencil icon will appear.

(ii) Click it to open the Update Account Information window for editing.

<div class="callout callout-bg-5 callout-border-5 callout-color-1">
<div class='callout-emoji'>🎁</div>
<p>Note and attachment cannot both be empty.</p>
</div>

(iii) After submitting the information, the modification and approval details can be viewed in the "To Do" section of work order approvals at the top right. This page also allows viewing of past submissions and approvals.

(iv) After the work order is approved, an "Update Account Information" entry will appear in the "Operation Records."

# 1.2B Q: How do I add remark information?

Answer: On the "KYC &gt; Account Opening List" detail page, click "Add Account Remark" at the bottom to enter information or upload attachments.

<div class="callout callout-bg-5 callout-border-5 callout-color-1">
<div class='callout-emoji'>🎁</div>
<p>Related entries can be found in the &quot;Operation Records&quot; on the account detail page.</p>
</div>

# 1.2C Q: Is there a notification when information is changed? (Modifications via Account Opening List and Work Order Center)

Answer: Modifications via Account Opening List: changing customer information on the "KYC &gt; Account Opening List" detail page does not send notifications.

Modifications via Work Order Center: when submitting a modification work order under "Work Order Center &gt; Modify Customer Data / Modify Contact Information," you can choose whether to notify the customer. For example: modifying login mobile number / login email / contact email and phone.

# 1.2D Q: Can customers add multiple emails to receive statements?

Answer: Yes. On "Account Management &gt; Customer Account Information &gt; Modify Contact Information," click "Add." In the "Modifications" section click "More contact emails" to add multiple email addresses to receive statements.

# 1.2E Q: Can we restrict customer App functions such as online trading / foreign exchange / IPO subscription?

Answer: (i) In the backend, go to "Account Management &gt; Account List" and click "Trading Permissions."

(ii) Click "Edit." Uncheck the permissions you do not want to grant to restrict the customer, then click "Save."

# 1.2F Q: During data migration, where can I view the old customer's "authorized person" information?

Answer: The old customer's "authorized person" information can be viewed by clicking "Details" in "Account Management &gt; Account List" and checking the "Agent" section on the "Customer Details" page (see Fig. 1.2F-1); authorized person information for newly opened corporate accounts is completed during offline account opening. To add or modify an authorized agent for a corporate account: edit or delete the "Authorized Person Information" in "KYC &gt; Account Opening List" (see Fig. 1.2F-2).

<div class="callout callout-bg-5 callout-border-5 callout-color-1">
<div class='callout-emoji'>🎁</div>
<p>If you want to standardize agent information, you must add and unify the authorized persons for new corporate accounts and old migrated accounts on the &quot;Customer Details&quot; page.</p>
</div>

# 1.2G Q: How do I maintain different risk ratings within customer information?

Answer:

1. The "Risk tolerance" in "Asset Investment Information" is completed by the customer when submitting the account opening.
2. The "Risk level" in "Work Order Information" defaults to "Low Risk" and requires backend operators to assess and update it.
3. Risk assessments that customers complete in the app are displayed under "Risk Assessment."
