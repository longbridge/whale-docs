# Audience Profiles

## How to create user segments?

The Delivery System supports creating user segments via two methods: rule-based creation and import-based creation. Choose according to your needs.

<img src="/assets/QhbnbeVLgo74ttx6idejadAup0e.png" src-width="582" src-height="366" align="center"/>

### Rule-Based User Segmentation

Create segments by setting rules based on user attributes and user behaviors. You may choose to:

1. Use only user attributes
2. Use only user behaviors
3. Use both user attributes and user behaviors

Result Update Note: Saved segments are recalculated using the segment rules each time they are requested to obtain the latest data.

<img src="/assets/ULaWb9KFeo9RUWx7uypjh8o3pGe.png" src-width="3068" src-height="1704" align="center"/>

### Import-Based User Segmentation

Create segments by importing a list of specified ids. The system matches the imported ids; successfully matched ids are saved in the segment results. The imported id must be a unique user identifier: member_id.
