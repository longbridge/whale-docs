# System Overview

# System Introduction

# Overview

The Whale CRM system enables brokers to view and manage, online, the personal basic information and account-opening/funding information of all registered clients under their firms; it also supports brokers in proactively advancing target clients through their lifecycle, efficiently converting registered clients into active accounts.

For brokers that maintain client relationships through Account Managers, the system allows online management of the Account Manager team and supports assigning clients to corresponding Account Managers according to defined rules, thereby achieving more efficient and user-friendly client service.

The CRM system includes modules such as Client List, Account Managers, My Dashboard, Task Follow-up, and Today's Completion.

# Menu Description

## Client List

<b>Path:</b> Client Management System &gt; CRM &gt; Client List

After clients of each broker successfully register through the method specified by the broker, their data are aggregated into the Client List menu. When a client completes actions on the platform such as account opening, funding, trading, or inviting others, the Client List records the relevant information.

You can perform operations for different clients such as [Follow-up], [Assign Account Manager], and [Batch Remarks].
