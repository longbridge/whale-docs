# 🪀 Improvements and Fixes

- Withdrawal Rules - Added work order approval for Automatic Audit Rules
    - New feature: All operations on Automatic Audit Rules (including [Create], [Edit], [Delete], and bulk [Enable / Disable]) will generate a new work order audit upon submission. The work order title is "Automatic Audit Rule Edit" (work order identifier: atm.withdraw_audits_edit); after go-live, the work order is preset to automatic approval. If manual approval is required, this can be modified in Approval Process Configuration.
